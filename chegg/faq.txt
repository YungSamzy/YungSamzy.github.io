How does this work?
The website looks through a leaked database to see if your chegg answer was leaked.

What leaked database?
A shady website bought a Chegg subscription and was reselling answers, an anonymous user on BreachedForums leaked the database, it contains around 10,000 leaked questions and answers. This website simply looks though it for you.

Are you hosting the leaked database?
NO! The database is linked from a thirdparty that we have no affiliation with.
